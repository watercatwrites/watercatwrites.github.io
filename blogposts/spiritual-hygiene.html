    <h1> Tips for those who have a spiritual practice, or those seeking clarity and an improved state of being. </h1>
		<p> 1. A stronger presence. </p>
    <p> When we tend to our own garden and have mindful practices, our moment to moment has more room for creativity and enjoyment of just being. When we keep up with our holistic health, we are more observant and aware of our surroundings. Someone who is getting familiar with their own feelings will be able to notice when something affects them negatively, and make a change of course. Meditation rids of distractions and grounds you into the present. 
  </p>

              <p>  2. A clear mind. </p>
<p> When our needs are met and the cache is cleared, we have more time and energy to focus on what we want! Spiritual hygiene can focus the mind on doing one thing at a time. Worries are like background static that sucks up the electricity bill. Take the time to regularly clear your mind, and you will have a barrier between your vision and someone elseâ€™s negativity.  </p>

                                                                 <p> 3. In touch with spirit. </p>
<p> Having a regular practice of cleansing and banishing puts us in sync with the spiritual side of things. Can you meditate, or just sit in your favorite spot until you reach its spiritual side? Feeling the presence of spirit will be different from person to person. Mindfulness is the key to unlocking the spirit world.</p>

                                                        <p>4. Intuition </p>
<p> Regular check-ins with yourself help tap into your natural inner guidance system. How are you feeling today? Maybe you notice that you feel a bit slower today than usual. What is your inner guidance trying to tell you?  Meditation is the key to engaging the psychic senses. When we meditate, we can listen to the automatic thoughts that pop up. Getting to know these thoughts is helpful and essential to a magical practice. Your psychic senses will deepen when you can decipher your own thoughts from spiritual messages.

                                                            <p> 5. Less negative experiences out of your control.  </p>
<p>  Regular banishing of negativity, old patterns, or hate from others transmutes the unwanted into an act of self-love. Instead of dwelling on what went wrong, it is acknowledged and let go. Stop giving others power by affirming their actions as hateful.   </p>

     <p> 6. Strengthens our natural psychic defenses.
 </p>
<p> Have you ever taken on energy from someone? It is far more common and likely than you think. Negativity will bounce off of strong defenses, and keep you centered in the present moment. Setting yourself up for success begins with your thought pattern. Start your day in spirit by meditating, praying, or writing. This creates a container for your day so you do not get overwhelmed or take on too much energy.

	<h2> Daily rituals for spiritual hygiene: </h2>
  <p> 1. Breath work. Focusing on the breath takes you out of the past or future and places you in the in-between. I like to do a three part breath - breathe into your belly, then lungs, then face. Exhale face, lungs, then belly.</p>
<p> 2. Banishing when you get home for the day. You can get creative here. What signals to your brain that you are done with work and ready to enjoy your home? You can visualize the days gunk flowing off your body in the shower. You can smoke cleanse with incense. You can imagine yourself unglued in flames.  </p>
<p> 3. A physically clean body and space. Spiritual hygiene starts with personal hygiene. Before you try to get rid of negativity at work, get rid of it at home. </p>
