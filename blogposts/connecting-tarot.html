    <h1> How to be a Better Tarot Card Reader </h1>
		<p>  Tarot cards are a tool used to determine probable outcomes, connect with spirit, and reflect current themes going on. Reading cards opens up psychic ability by using intuition, gut feelings, and symbolism. My clairvoyance has improved greatly by using the tips below. </p>
		<img src="" alt="" style="width:700px;height:800px;">
		<p> 1.Draw three cards at a time and observe how the symbolism changes or stays the same in each. Do you see how the lighting takes down the building, and makes room for a new tree?  Do you see how things around you look dark, because you are not facing the sun? How would you interpret these messages? How do they make you feel? </p>

              <p>  2. 2. What catches your eye first? Notice what your natural instincts are drawn to. I pulled justice and my mind was blank but my eyes went to the scales. Where has order been restored in my life? Am I balanced or do I need to find balance? Are the odds stacked against me right now? Your body knows how to be psychic and pick up on subtle influences.  </p>

                                                                 <p> 3. Try new shuffling and pulling techniques. No matter how many cards I pull from the top, there is always a big message from the card on the bottom of the deck. Ask the cards how they want to be shuffled. If they need an extra shuffling hand they will let you know! Split the deck in half and see if there is a hidden message in the middle. 
 </p>

                                                        <p>4. These cards reflect themes that are already around you. If the cards don’t make sense, try reflecting on what life lessons you are currently going through. I repeatedly pulled the Chariot during a time of harsh realizations and maturity. The Chariot can show the need to keep focused while life throws you challenges.  </p>

                                                            <p> 5. Use the cards as reflection prompts for your day. For the empress - Where can I add more pleasure into my life? What am I currently giving birth to? Freehand journaling usually helps me get to the bottom of things when I am unsure.

	<h2> Bonus Tips </h2>
  <p> 1.Choose a deck that fits your style, you will connect with the imagery more.
 </p>
<p> 2. Wrap your cards in a black cloth to keep their energy contained. </p>
<p> 3. Research what the card means and create your own artwork for the theme.
