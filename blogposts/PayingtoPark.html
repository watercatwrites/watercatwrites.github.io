  <h1>The Parking Meter Money Machine</h1>
<p> 
  On March 3, 2023, Hendersonville will require everybody to park on Main Street for $2 an hour. Even though they just put in the new parking deck, it apparently wasn’t taxing enough on Hendo citizens. 

I am a disabled 22-year-old woman who works on Main Street. I rely on handicap parking in order to work. Handicap parking was free up until a month ago when it was voted on, and will go in place tomorrow. 

I had to read about the new Handicap parking laws on a flyer at Black Bear Coffee. My boss was not even informed of the handicap law changes. Are disabled people who work on Main Street supposed to pay $10 every day just to work? Are employers supposed to cover their employees' parking fees? This has never been an issue until now. Am I supposed to find the closest free parking and limp many blocks to get to work?

Main Street business owners are furious because their voices and concerns are dismissed. The people who made Main Street what it is today are being pushed out. The parking fees are not fair because they are hurting business. Regular customers have said they won’t be shopping here after the fees are in place. 

As the men were putting in the meters, I overheard a conversation. One of the guys claimed the meters would drive up sales for Main Street businesses. How? 

How will we keep the quaint charm of Hendersonville if our locals have to pay to enjoy it? This is not the charm that Hendersonville was built upon and it will not fall apart if these people continue digging into our wallets. 

The spirit of Hendersonville is cozy, quaint, rich in history and alive with the spirit of the people. The people deserve a voice and a vote.

Paying for parking is one step closer to stripping Hendersonville of its culture and locals.
