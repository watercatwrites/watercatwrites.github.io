    <h1>Guide to Hearty Mountain Meals </h1>
		<p> Gathering around a fire for a home cooked meal is rejuvenating for the body, mind, and soul. Our food and the way we cook with it creates a symbiotic relationship with the earth. The roaring fire that we use to cook our food is the hearth of our home that keeps our spirit alive and well. 
  </p>
    <p> During a camping or cabin trip you will want to pack lightly. I have created a list of meals with inexpensive nutritious healthy items that can be used for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

              <p>  1. Spam and Eggs </p>
<p> For breakfast we cooked spam and eggs around the campfire on a cast iron pan with butter. This meal is easy, filling, and has lots of protein so you can keep up on your hike! 2 cans of spam and a carton of eggs supplied our vacation breakfast almost everyday. 
- Butter, low sodium spam, sunny side up eggs, dill </p>

                                                                 <p> 2. Pasta salad </p>
<p> Pasta salad makes a healthy lunch. I used red onion, tomatoes, cucumber, and wild onions mixed in with orzo and a light dressing of vinegar and mustard because I forgot to bring the rest of the ingredients. The best thing about this recipe is that you get a serving of veggies in with your pasta. 
- Orzo pasta, tomatoes, red onion, cucumber, wild onion found on Wisemanâ€™s view, red vinegar, mustard. P.s. this was not very good and 
I hope you add better ingredients if you make this. We did not have what we needed for the sauce but it was fine and healthy! </p>

                                                        <p> 3. Refueling snack board </p>
<p> My boyfriend and I have a tradiition of making a board with apples, nuts, and his homemade bourbon caramel. This is the easiest thing to throw together for a delicious nutritious afternoon snack. This plate pairs well with a glass of wine! 
- Green apples, mixed nuts, bourbon caramel

                                                            <p> 4. Bread </p>
<p> My boyfriend is also a baker and made two pans of bread for our trip. We sat by the fire and ate bread with butter at dusk. Bread is a staple that I could eat any time of day. We paired it with hot dogs a few nights that we roasted over the fire. 
- Yeast, water, eggs, baking soda, bread flour  </p>

5. Any potatoes </p?
<p> Besides from a huge bag of potatoes we also had potatoes and hash from a can. A huge bag of potatoes can be created into many more delicious meals. Mashed potatoes was served for dinner the first night! </p>
